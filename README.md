## Lifecycle Stages - Intake

Below is the Customer/End-User Portal experience in creating a ticket to submit to the help desk. ⬇️

## User Client Portal Dashboard:
	
 - To open a new ticket, click on one of the two “Open a New Ticket” buttons

</p>

When you click the button, you will be redirected to a blank ticket form, where you can share the required contact details for the ticket, such as the email address, the ticket owner's name, phone number, etc. In addition, you will see a Help Topics field. By choosing a help topic, you are able to direct and streamline the information you are submitting to the help desk.  Select the appropriate help topic related to the issue you are experiencing. Make a brief description in the issue summary—think of this as the subject line of an email. Share as much detail as you would like in the body of the message. Use the HTML Rich Text toolbar to format your message, upload and share photos and videos, and attach hyperlinks. When you have completed filling out your ticket, be sure to click the “Create Ticket” button. ⬇️

After submission, the customer will receive a notification letting them know that their ticket/request has been created or received.

When a ticket is created, it will be assigned to an Agent or a Team based on the Department or Help Topic listed in the column. Alternatively, it can be assigned to an Agent listed in the column. This assignment process must be completed within a specific timeframe.

## Working on the issue: 

When the Help Desk Agent or admin logs in, they can now see the available tickets that have been assigned/not assigned. A ticket can be assigned automatically to themselves or to another team member. With the ticket, Agents communicate with the customer or end-user to resolve the ticket submitted.

Agents have two options for updating the status of a ticket. They can manually update it or update the system automatically based on certain business rules.

During the "Working the Issue(s)" stage, the requester will be informed about their ticket's status and provided with a detailed outline of the steps to find a potential solution.

## Resolution:

Finally, the ticket is either closed or marked as resolved when the issue is resolved. Since it reached a resolution, it will now be reflected in the 'closed' tickets column. However, it is important to note that this outcome may or may not align with the requester's desired outcome.
